# A-Search-Algorithm
Implementation of A* algorithm using Java and a coordinate grid plane. A grid plane is randomly generated with certain nodes being pathable and others being unpathable

Usage: Run AStar class

  
Result:
    
    0 = pathable node
    1 = unpathable node
    S = start node
    P = path taken
    E = ending node


Note: Manhattan method used for calculating heuristic
