# A-Search-Algorithm
Implementation of A* algorithm using Java and a coordinate grid plane. A grid plane is randomly generated with certain nodes being pathable and others being unpathable

Usage: 
  Run AStar class
  Enter row of start node
  Enter col of start node
  Enter row of ending node
  Enter col of ending node
  
Result:
  A coordinate grid with:
    0 = pathable node
    1 = unpathable node
    S = start node
    P = path taken
    E = ending node
